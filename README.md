https://ohwr.org/cern_ohl_s_v2.pdf

This is the repository for the Community Edition Release of the legacy from Neva Aerospace Ltd (UK) for the Static Thrust Electric Ducted Fan (EDF) Athena.
The Athena-A-2ET-V1.64 is a 2 stages contra-rotative elecric ducted fan optimised for static thrust (hovering) with maximum linear speed under 50kph (30mph).

The maximum thrust last checked in 2023 where between 3.7kgf to 4.1Kgf - depending on the make of the Athena with 6S motors and one-pass epoxy-coated PLA blades on the rotors.
